Scripts for automated data taking using timestamp7 on two machines.
Put script in crontab to run every X minutes or x hours.
Outputs rawevents with timetag and identity.
timetag appended to time_list.
Process file goes through time_list and creates epoch files.

from epoch file list, pfind_script runs pfind with specified 
1) number of epoch
2) buffer size.
3) fine resolution
4) coarse resolution
5) skip epoch
Optimise until pfind works in all cases.
To check qualitatively that pfind works, see that it converge to same tdiff increasing number of epoch and buffer size.
To check quantitatively that it works, do g2 with the and offset with time difference found and see that the peak is there with the correct amplitude 
total good coicidences in rawevents = area under the g2 peak. # 20220628 run has ~1000 coincidence per second
This is implemented in plot_peaks.py
